about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
 I'm a PhD candidate in the field of mathematical psychology. My speciality is using a combination of experimentation (both on the web and in the laboratory) and computational models to understand how people make decisions about the content of their memory over time.
 
 I'm excited, in general, by the application of modelling to develop novel insights into why things happen (i.e. the specific processes that govern some phenomenon). I also enjoy communicating these sorts of insights by visualising my analyses and finding the story in complex data.

          During my candidature, I learnt most of my key skills that I hope to apply and grow throughout my career. I also developed soft skills that I think will prove useful in meeting new challenges, such as working to deadline and managing expectations and morale.
